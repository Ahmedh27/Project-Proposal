# EventLink  

## Project by  
**Ahmed Hamouda** and Team  

## Problem Description:
People often struggle to find relevant local events or coordinate meetups with friends. Existing event platforms can be cluttered, filled with irrelevant content, or lack proper organization for small group planning. EventLink simplifies event discovery and planning by allowing users to find local events, create private or public gatherings, and seamlessly coordinate logistics with friends.

## Primary Users:
- **College Students** – Finding campus events, study groups, and social gatherings.  
- **Young Professionals** – Connecting with industry networking events and social meetups.  
- **Community Organizers** – Managing event promotions, RSVPs, and communication.
